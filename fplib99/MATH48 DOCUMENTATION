    Introduktion:
   ============================================================
     Math48 is a floating numbers mathematic package for Z-80 based
     microcomputers. The program which occupy only 2.5 KByte, converts
     6 of the Z-80 processors 16-bit registers to two floating numbers
     accumulators, with 40 bits mantissa and 8 bits exponent. This
     architecture makes it possible to perform very fast floating
     number calculations with app. 11 significant digits.

     Math48 contain 25 subroutines with these functions:

       Addition, Subtraktion, Multiplikation, and Division
       Modulus and Exponentiation
       Square rooth computation
       Trigonometric and inverse trigonometric functions
       Log and Exponentiation functions
       Whole numbers and fractional calculations
       Convertion to and from 16-bits fixed number
       convertion from tekststreng to floating point
       Formatted printout in fixed figitpoint or exponential notation.

     Math48 require no other workspace than the system stak,
     This will make recursive programmering possible, at the same time as
     it eases the programming, because a work space assignment to fixed
     addresses is not needed.

    Floating number format.
   ============================================================

     A floating number is made by the three 16-bit registers BC, DE and HL
     (collectively called AC) or the corresponding alternative registers
     BC', DE' og HL' (collectively called AC').

     The five 8-bit registers B,C,D,E and H (Collectively called BCDEH) represent
     in the mentioned succession the number mantissa in binary representation.
     The binary decimal point is placed immediately in front of the B register.
     In this way, the bit 7 of B tell the number of halves (2^-1) in the number,
     bit 6 the number of quarters (2^-2) etc.
     The value of the mantissa may also be aprehended as the binary integer
     BCDEH divided by 2^40.

     The L register contain the number exponent, that is the number 2 must be
     raised to, to give the factor that the mantissa shall be multiplied by.
     The absolute value of the L register is the exponent plus
     128 (80H). If for example L has the value 83H the exponent will be 3.
     If L has the value 7DH the exponent is -3.
     If L is zero it tells that the whole number is zero. In this way the
     exponent may take any integer value between -127 (01H) and 127 (FFH).

     Of this it is seen that the number in AC shall be comprehended in the
     following way.

         AC=(BCDEH/2^40)*2^(L-128)

     Where BCDEH is a whole binary number.

     As the exponent is the power that 2 shall be raised to, then it is given,
     that the value of AC is doubled if one is added to the exponent, and
     halved if one is subtracted from the exponent.
     Likewise it is given that the number in BCDEH is doubled if it is shifted
     one bit to the left and halved if it is shifted one bit to the right.
     One may therefore, theoretically speaking, shift BCDEH to right or
     left an arbitrary number of bits, as long as this number is added or
     subtracted from the exponent.

     The above stated is exploited in every calculation to normalize
     the number in AC:
     The mantissa (BCDEH) is repeatedly shifted one bit left untill the
     most significant bit is set (bit 7 in B). Hereafter the number of shifts are
     subtracted from the exponent.

     This normalizing is done for two reasons: firstly is is
     securing that the number has the maximum precision, as it
     leaves the most significant bits in the mantissa.
     Secondly it releases the most significant bit of the mantissa,
     as this bit will always be set in a normalized number. The most
     significant bit is in stead used as a sign indicator:
     If it is set then the number is negative. If it is zero then the number
     is positive. The absolute value of a number may thus be calculated
     by simply resetting the bit 7 in the B register.

     The construction of a floating number is compiled to:

         Reg. Bit    Meaning

          B    7     Sign. 0=Positive. 1=Negative.
          B   6-0    mantissa bit   38-32. Bit 39 always set.
          C   7-0    mantissa bit   31-24.
          D   7-0    mantissa bit   23-16.
          E   7-0    hantisse bit   15-8.
          H   7-0    hantisse bit   7-0.
          L   7-0    L=0: the number is Zero.
                     L>0: Exponent+128 (80H).

     If a floating point number is zero (ie. if the L register is zero)
     then it does'nt matter what is in the mantissa as long as the sign
     bit is zero.

      4800000000  87  100               (2^-1+2^-2+2^-5)*2^7.
      4CCCCCCCCD  7D  0.1               Not final
      0000000000  01  2.938735877E-39   Smallest possible number.
      7FFFFFFFFF  FF  1.701411835E+38   Largest possible number.
     ===================================================================

     Notice that the number 0.1 is NOT final. this proves, that a number
     having a final number of digits in one number system (here the decimal system)
     does not necessarily have a finite number of digits in another
     (here the binary number system)

     The following method may be used to convert numbers from the decimal system
     to floating point number format (in hex notation):

     1)   Make the number positive. Take the binary logarithm of the number
          (log2(x)=ln(x)/ln(2)), and round to the nearest integer
          that is larger than the result. This is the exponent.

     2)   Divide the number by 2 raised to the exponent. The number now
          lies in the interval 1>X>=0.5, which means thet the number is
          normalized

     3)   Multiply by 16. The integer part of the result
          (minus 8 if the number we convert was positive) is the
          first hexdigit in the mantissa. that is. MSD in B register.

     4)   Subtract the integer from the number, so that it now lies
          in the interval 1>X>=0. Again multiply by 16. The integer part
          of the result is the second hexdigit in the mantissa,
          that is LSD in B register.

          continue in this manner until the remaining 8 hex digits are
          computed. if the 11.th. hex digit is larger than 7 the number
          should be rounded by adding 1 to BCDEH.

    Math48 SUBRUTINES
   ============================================================
     In the following we use these abbreviations:

          AC   The floating number accumulator made by the 3
               16-bit registers BC, DE and HL.
          AC'   The floating number accumulator made by the 3
               16-bit  alternative registers BC', DE' and HL'.
          CF   Carry flag in the statusregister F.
          ZF   Zero flag in the statusregister F.

     By call of a MATH49 subroutine the following registers
     are changed: AC, AF and AF'. The registers AC', IX and IY do
     not change value.

     In the description of each single subroutine, the following
     data is given:

     NAME:        Name of the Subroutine.
     FUNCTION:    The function performed by the subroutinen.
     OFFSET:      The hexnumber to be added to Math48 startaddress
                  to get the subroutine startaddress.
     INPUT:       If this field is shown it gives the parameters
                  necessary for the subroutinen, except for AC
                  and possibly AC'.
     OUTPUT:      If this field is shown it gives the parameters
                  returned by the subroutine, except for AC.
     STACK:       The maximum number of bytes used on the stack
                  except the 2 bytes used in the call.
     EXAMPLE:     Possible number examples.

     If a calculation gives an overflow (the absolute value of
     AC would exceed 1.701411835E+38) then CF is set to 1. By
     overflow the number in AC is undefined.
     If a calculation gives an underflow (the absolute value of
     AC would be less than 2.938735877E-39) then AC is set to 0.

                and FIELDS). the format can be one of two possibilities.

                     saaaaa.bbbbb       Fixed pint notation
                     sa.bbbbbEtxx       Exponential notation

                S    Sign.
                aaa  Integer part (by exponential notation this part
                     only has one digit).
                bbb  Decimal part.
                E    Indicates exponential notation.
                t    the exponent sign (always "+" or "-").
                xx   Two digit exponent.

                The two following bytes has the following meaning:

                FLAGS:   This byte determins the format type

                Bit 0     Printing type
                           0 - Fixed point notation
                           1 - Exponential notation
                Bit2-1    Sign format
                           00 - No sign
                           01 - AC>=0: No sign
                                AC<0:  "-"
                           10 - AC>=0: " "
                                AC<0:  "-"
                           11 - AC>=0: "+"
                                AC<0:  "-"
                Bit  3    Decimal part format
                           0 - only significant digits
                           1 - Write all digits
                Bit  4    Integer part format
                           0 - Only significant digits
                           1 - Blanks before significant digits

                FIELDS:   This byte contain the length of the integer
                          and decimal fields.

                Bit 3-0   Decimal field length (0-15). If the length
                          is zero, no decimal point is written.
                Bit 7-1   Integer field length (1-15). A length of zero
                          will always result in an error, if fixed point
                          notation is selected. If exponential notation
                          is selected then the content of these 4 bits
                          are irrelevant as only 1 digit is printed.
             The user should make sure that the text buffer the IX
             register points at, at least has the length of DF+HF+2 for
             fixed point notation, and DF+8 for exponential notation,
             where DF is the decimal field length and HF is the integer
             field length.

     OUTPUT: CF=0: The textbuffer contain the formatted number
                   terminated by a byte with the value zero.
             CF=1: The number cannot be converted in the specified
                   format. the textbuffer is untouched.

             In the following examples FLAGS is given in binary
             notation, and FIELDS in hexnotation:

     Convert a textstring to Floating point number
     ---------------------------------------------

     NAME:      CNVN
     FUNCTION:  Convert the textstring that the IX register point
                at, to a floating point number, and save the result
                in AC.
     OFFSET:    48H
     STACK:     20 bytes.
     INPUT:     IX register point to the first character in the
                textstring. The textstring must have one of the
                following formats:

                1)   saaa.bbb

                    s    Sign: If s is not present the number is assumed
                         to be positive. If s is present it must be "+"
                         or "-".
                    aaa  Integer part (any number of digits).
                    bbb  Decimal part (any number of digits).

                2)   saaa.bbbEtxx

                    E    Indicates that the number is followed by a 10's
                         exponent.
                    t    Exponent sign: If t is not present the exponent is
                         assumed to be positive. If t is present then it
                         must be "+" or "-".
                    xx   Exponent in the range 37>=xx>=-37.

                    The conversion stops at the first character that does
                    Not fit in the format.

     OUTPUT:    CF=0: AC contain the converted number.
                      IX point at the character immediately after the
                      number.
                CF=1: Overflow.

     EXAMPLE:   This program sets AC equal to 189.445:

                START:   LD   IX,NUMBER   ;Point at textstring
                         CALL CNVN        ;Convert
